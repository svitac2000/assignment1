					<p>For My IT project idea, I decided to plan the development of a video game, as that will help me towards my goal of a career in the gaming industry, while also helping me gain a better understanding of what is required to develop a game from start to finish.<br> <br> I was initially inspired to develop a game similar to a browser game by the name of <a href="https://trap-thecat.com" target="_blank"> Trap the Cat 	</a>.  Trap the Cat has the player black out squares in a hexagon-based grid in an attempt to stop the ‘cat’ from escaping the mat. I thought an interesting spin on the game would be to have the player attempt to escape in a similar fashion, while the game attempted to trap them in and keep them from escaping.  

I find this project interesting as it will give me an incredible opportunity to research the process of creating a game from scratch, as well as potentially, through the creation of artifacts, try my hand at some simple game design elements.<br> <br> I settled on this project when I had the idea while brainstorming other possible endeavours, that the game could be set within a maze or labyrinth, and feature the player trying to avoid a NPC that attempts to track them down before they can escape. 

My vision for a strong first iteration of the game would be a 2-Dimensional top down game, where the player would try and solve a set of pre-designed mazes, while avoiding an enemy NPC. The player would start on the edge of the maze, which would be made out of a complex hex-based grid, and try to work their way to the goal, with the NPC spawning as an obstacle, somewhere between the player and their objective. My vision is for the player to be represented by a sprite of a greek hoplite, and the enemy a minotaur, because I think tying the game to a strong theme will help add to its appeal, while also reinforcing the ‘cat and mouse’ gameplay mechanics.

<br> <br>The levels would be specifically designed, and essentially have preset solutions, wherein taking certain paths would guarantee completion of the level, but multiple correct solutions would exist as the only real requirement will be to solve the maze without being “caught” by the minotaur. By setting this initial target, and having a controlled environment, the game will be able to have its fundamental principles defined as the first simple levels are created. However, as development continues, later levels could contain more complex mechanics, where perhaps the minotaur is able to track the players through the maze by following their footsteps, or hear noises, and the addition of secondary objectives or hidden advantages throughout the level. 

<br> <br>Visually, the project would be designed in an art style inspired by games such as Stardew Valley and Undertale. Both feature a pixel art style in their characters and interactive elements, with background elements more smoothly painted, so that points of interest can be better highlighted. This visual style is a realistically achievable goal, as it does not require advanced hardware or programs to create, or to execute effectively, thanks to its simplistic and minimalistic nature. 


<br> <br>The games format follows the approach of other popular online JavaScript games such as <a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game" target="_blank"> The World’s Hardest Game </a>, or <a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-bloxorz" target="_blank"> Bloxorz</a>, to name only two. Both games introduce you to their core concepts very quickly, with their first levels providing the building blocks with which a player can learn the strategy of the game. These initial tutorial levels are both very well designed, because they teach you how the game introduces new elements, and therefore, as later levels grow more and more complex, it is very easy as a player to identify new elements as they are introduced. It also allows the developer a chance to communicate to the player how they expect them to interact with new elements or mechanics. The project development could begin with the creation of a robust tutorial. This would allow the potential for an inexperienced developer to constantly expand on a project and introduce new concepts and mechanics level by level, while learning how to implement them in an interesting IT and visual format along the way. 

<br> <br>This project is not extremely technically demanding to execute, it could be created in an open source program such as Cocos2d or Godot  as both could certainly handle the technical components of the game. The project would need to be coded in either C++ or JavaScript, as those are the most commonly supported programming languages for game design and development. Creation of game elements such as the character sprites and maze designs would also require additional design programs, while other future game elements or iterations of the project could require animation software also. 

<br> <br>Completing the project would be achievable by an individual proficient in either of the aforementioned programming languages, and proficiency with a games development tool, although those skills could be acquired along the way by using building blocks to grow knowledge first incrementally, but as the project progressed, exponentially. 

<br> <br>A successful completion of this project would result in the development of the game, to a playable standard. The game would have multiple levels including a tutorial, each level increasing both the amount of different obstacles the player will have to face, and the complexity and size of the mazes. It would have a visually interesting design for the maze walls, with character sprites portraying some sort of character or animation while moving around the maze. To be successful as a game however, it would also require the creation of promotional material such as an animation or artwork explaining how the player came to be trapped in the maze, and potentially the creation of a series of achievements, to guide the player through the completion of the game’s levels.
