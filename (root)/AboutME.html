						G’day there, I’m Gilbert Williams. 
						I am a 22 year old Australian man from Hobart, Tasmania. 
						I work in sales at a JB-Hifi and this is my first proper foray into tertiary study,
						after a gap year and the pandemic delayed my previous attempts.
						I’m a very creative person and a self-described nerd. I enjoy playing D&D, and all forms of games including table-top, online, and single player experiences.<br> <br>
						To help you get to know me and my sense of humor, try and guess which of the following two statements is true, and which one is a lie. <br><br>
						I’ve competed in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, on a yacht called Martela, which is also the name of a Scandinavian furniture brand, there's no association whatsoever.<br>
						<br> I am an expert skier, confident on nearly any graded slope, although last time I went, I did <b> nearly</b> ski off a cliff. Keyword there is <u>nearly</u>, I stopped in time.
						<br><br>I 3-D printed and painted the model in my photo. (It’s an Ohm from Studio Ghibli’s <i> Nausicaa Valley of the Wind</i>.)<br>
						<br> Check if you guessed correctly on the "Two Truths and a Lie" page!<br>
						<br> My interest in IT began as a child, playing games like Lego Star Wars on the family computer, and going through my education with computers and technology becoming more and more common as the years went on. I’ve had jobs that dealt with IT including working at Telstra, and my current job where I sell nearly every electronic device under the sun. However, I have also had jobs where IT and connected systems made my time there easier, or much, much harder. Jobs like McDonalds, where their sales projection systems try their best to tell you how many chicken nuggets you should cook, and allow for the speed of service they offer. And I’ve also worked in a rural supplies store with a terribly managed program for sales and stock management, So I understand how IT isn't perfect, but also that it can be used as a very effective tool in today’s world. 

<br> <br>I chose RMIT to study IT for its reputation of providing quality education, from professors and tutors with industry experience. I’ve had a few friends who have graduated from RMIT and one or two are still studying, and they only have positive things to say about the courses and instructors. I am also taking Intro to Programming to dip my toes in the water of a Bachelor of IT. RMIT is also one of the few universities in Australia to offer a Bachelor of Design (Games) degree, and as the gaming industry would be my desired landing point after graduating, I obviously found that a compelling reason to come study here. 

<br> <br>Throughout my studies I expect and hope to learn about the technology that powers our world, and the process of creating that technology. I will make an effort to study closely the ways in which programs are designed, and how problems that arise can be tackled, including everything from practical coding skill, to broader concepts like how to approach creating something from scratch, and managing its progress to completion. 

<br> <br>My ideal job within the IT industry would definitely be to work as a Software Engineer or Designer within the gaming industry. I found a job ad for a Game Development Software Engineer on Seek, that if i was graduated, I would definitely apply for, please find the link below: 

	<br> <br><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/58322894?type=standout#sol=4a1382549ad60bf19e7ebc7418462448d56506e4" target="_blank"> https://www.seek.com.au/job/58322894?type=standout#sol=4a1382549ad60bf19e7ebc7418462448d56506e4 </a>


<br> <br>The job is at Konami Australia, a well known games publisher, famous for titles such as Metal Gear Solid, and Silent Hill. The position would involve designing and creating programs, as well as collaborating with a wide range of departments on all possible and theoretical game elements. I chose the listing because although I have a strong creative drive and would find great satisfaction from developing my own game from start to finish, I want to gain a strong understanding of the process, the requirements, so that when I have the experience to lead a project, it can be more successful. 

<br> <br>The position requires a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or Engineering, or an equivalent level of education or experience. It also requires proficiency in C++. All the other skills called for on the ad are not necessarily mandatory, but the perfect applicant would have proficiency in C# and Unity, as well as more than a year of previous experience in the gaming industry and software development. The role also clearly positions working with large groups of people and a multitude of departments, so a strong ability to communicate and collaborate would give any applicant a real edge. 

<br> <br>Currently, I would not even be shortlisted for this position, as I have none of the required qualifications, and unfortunately no truly relevant work experience. I do however, possess many qualities that would make me highly successful within the role, once acquiring that experience. Those qualities include strong written and verbal communication skills, as well as a passion for solving problems, and coming up with interesting solutions. I love working in teams, and thrive when giving and receiving energy and effort from my co-workers. 

<br> <br>The majority of the gap between my current skills and the requirements for the role would be bridged by the completion of a Bachelor’s degree at RMIT. Whether that be a specialization in Games Design, or a broader education in IT or Software Engineering, as I am exposed to, and become aware of the subtle differences between them. And while I do hope to have a role that focuses on the more creative elements of designing a game, landing an entry level position at a games publisher or similar company is my goal once graduating. 

<br> <br>Myer Briggs Personality test result: ENFP-T “Campaigner” 

<br> <br><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality" target="_blank">16personalities.com </a>defines an ENFP as:
	
<br> <br><i>“A Campaigner (ENFP) is someone with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions.”</i>



<br> <br>I took the learning style tests at <a href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/" target="_blank"> vark-learn.com</a> and <a href="https://personalitymax.com/" target="_blank">personalitymax.com</a>. The results of the two tests corroborated with each other, delivering results that were very similar despite the slightly differing test formats. My primary learning style is aural, but calisthenic learning came a very close second. 

<br> <br>I also took <a href="https://www.typing.com" target="_blank">Typing.com’s</a> one minute typing test, averaging 42 words per minute. I took this test because it is a skill I wish to improve on, and being able to type quickly and effectively is a skill that would greatly improve the speed at which I can work both within my university studies, and within my employment. 

<br> <br>These test results confirmed a lot of things I already knew about myself. I have always thrived when around other people, and strive to build strong relationships. The learning style test was also a confirmation. I have always absorbed information well by hearing information, and then being  given an opportunity to put it into practice. The typing test, while not as introspective as the other two tests, gave me a solid benchmark that I can strive to improve upon, while also being an indicator with which I can gauge my working speed.

<br> <br>My results showed me that in a team environment, I am likely to facilitate conversations between members of the team, but it is also very important that I spend time absorbing the knowledge those around me have, as listening to the other members of the team explain their perspective of the project or task we are completing, will help me greatly to understand their expectations and understanding of the task’s requirements. The typing test, or a similar test could also be used to gauge the speed at which I could complete tasks compared to other members of the team, so that clearer timeframes for completion could be achieved. 

<br> <br>While forming or joining a team, I can use my results to find synergies with other people. My ideal team mates should have a preference for verbal communication, and group discussions to drive problem solving. They should also want to make decisions together, not unilaterally. It will also be important that prospective teammates are not oriented around formal exchanges of information, as my learning styles function best while discussing and completing the tasks in front of me, not strenuously planning for them.
